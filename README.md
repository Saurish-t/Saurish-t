# Hi, I’m Saurish Tripathi

I like building things with AI, coding apps that solve real problems, and diving into projects where tech meets impact.

-  Into machine learning, computer vision, and making data useful
-  Guitarist who learns various songs until it sounds just right
-  Cricket fan — caught a match ball on April 14th, 2025!
-  Built award-winning apps like Focusr (Congressional App Challenge)
-  Always chasing cool problems, especially at hackathons and clubs

> Currently a student at TJHSST, experimenting with ideas that might turn into something awesome.

Let's talk!
